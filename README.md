WebApp implementing Guess the Celebrity using Vanilla HTML, CSS and JS 

You will create:
- A single ***HTML document*** 
- A single ***CSS document*** 
- A single ***JavaScript document***

## Specifications:

- The content of the webpage are created by javascript code (html elements, events handling).
- The user should enter their name (it will be stored along with their score). This is validated by the program as an alphanumeric string.
- The webapp displays a picture of a celebrity one at a time and asks the user to guess/pick the name of the celebrity.  4 potential answers are provided with one being the correct one.
- The webapp picks a celebrity randomly. 
- The webapp keeps track of the user’s score.  
- The webapp displays three scores: the current score, the current user’s best score, and the overall best score on the computer/browser. 
- The webapp stores the user names along with the scores (current, best personal, all time best) in the browser’s localstorage. The scores are  updated correctly.


## Validation:
- Your JavaScript must be clean, readable, and ***ESLint warning-free*** 

- You may not use jQuery or any other JavaScript library package in this assignment. The goal of this activity is to get comfortable with low-level foundational JavaScript/DOM features. You may, however, use any JavaScript built-in functions.
